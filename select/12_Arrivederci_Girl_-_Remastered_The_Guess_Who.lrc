[00:09.95] You know that you're steppin' on me
[00:15.36] Draggin' my bone to bed
[00:19.80] You know that you're real politely
[00:25.27] Kickin' me right in my head
[00:29.73] But I want to move
[00:34.20] So leave me alone
[00:40.57] Distress me
[00:45.05] And give somebody else your own kind of lovin'
[00:52.22] Your kind of movin'
[00:54.90] You're kinda thinkin' about the wrong things too
[01:00.45] Good-bye my baby
[01:03.11] Arrivederci girl to you
