Boy-girl, boy-girl
When a boy meets a girl, boy-girl
Finding out, I'm finding out the things
That I've been talking about, I'm finding all the things
That I've been missing out, finding all the things
I lose my mind, sometimes fall behind
You and I we live on the big ship and time goes by
You make up and I believe a lady's lie
The skinheads call it strawberries and cream
Sometimes I scream
Boy-girl, boy-girl
When a boy meets a girl, boy-girl
We go out a picture or a disco or a roundabout
I walk you home, I hold you there, you're giving out
I open doors so I can shut your face, know your place
Boy-girl, boy-girl
When a boy meets a girl, boy-girl
You can take me in your hand
Stand back, leave me, come in
Up and down and all around
You will sideways to the ground
Boy-girl, boy-girl
When a boy meets a girl
